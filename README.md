quad_theory_next_front is a spa which build with next js and it's completely responsive in different devices.
Here i alwayes tried to make components run as server component.
In header section here is logo , search bar ,user icons and menu button
menu button has toggle dropdown inside list of options, which activate when i click in menu button.
Total app includes slider and footer is responsive and nice to view.

Popular and Recomended sections view with a scroll bar , our api products in a row for medium and greater then medium devices
Scroll bar has been hidden for less then medium devices.
